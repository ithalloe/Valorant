        what is it and how does it work
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Valorant is an exciting tactical shooter developed and published by Riot Games, known for its famous title
          League of Legends. Launched in 2020, Valorant quickly gained a huge fan base around the world. The game
          combines elements of first-person shooters (FPS) with strategic tactics, offering a unique and highly
          competitive experience. Set in the near future, Valorant pits players into teams of five against five, where
          each agent has special abilities that can be used to tactical advantage. With accurate shooting mechanics,
          well-designed maps, and a variety of unique characters, the game offers an intense and immersive experience
          for players of all skill levels.

        <h3 id="mid">Gameplay</h3>
        <li id="parte2">
          10 players are divided into two teams, Attackers and Defenders, with the aim of winning as many rounds as
          possible. To win a round, one of the teams has to eliminate the opposing team or complete their specific Spike
          objective. The first team to win 13 rounds wins the game. The game starts in a waiting room, where players
          have to choose their Agents. the lobby lasts for 80 seconds or until all players choose their Agents. Only one
          Agent can be selected per team, and players cannot see which Agent has been selected on the enemy team until
          the game's loading screen. The game starts with the First Buying Round. The Buy Round takes place before each
          round and lasts for 30 seconds. During the Buy Round, most areas of the map are inaccessible and the two teams
          cannot meet each other, so Attackers cannot enter catwalks and are limited to areas close to their spawn zone,
          while Defenders can move freely between catwalks, but nothing beyond that. Players are allowed to purchase
          weapons, shields and abilities during this phase.
